Purpose of this project is deconstruct Google homepage page and build it in my way in order to learn basics of HTML and CSS.


I'm aware the fact that footer isn't responsible correctly. I should have done it with DISPLAY: GRID property, but at some point when I was dealing with GRID on footer, I ran into a problem and changed this property to DISPLAY: FLEX. It wasn't a good idea but I decided to leave it in that state.
